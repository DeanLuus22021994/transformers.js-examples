# .copilot Directory Optimization

## Overview
This guide outlines our approach to optimizing the .copilot directory and implementing complementary extension integration.

## Directory Structure
```
.copilot/
  ├── prompts/          # Reusable prompt templates
  ├── snippets/         # Code snippets for Copilot
  ├── completions/      # Custom completion providers
  ├── commands/         # Custom commands
  ├── schemas/          # JSON schemas for validation
  └── config.json       # Configuration file
```

## Complementary Extension Design
Our extension will complement Copilot functionality by:
1. Providing specialized domain-specific suggestions
2. Implementing custom completion providers for our project
3. Adding contextual awareness for our codebase

## Integration Points
The complementary extension will:
- Share a common interface with Copilot
- Use a well-defined API for interaction
- Avoid tight coupling through event-based communication

## Module Separation
Clear boundaries between Copilot and our extension:

| Copilot Responsibility | Extension Responsibility |
|------------------------|--------------------------|
| General code completion | Domain-specific completion |
| Code explanation | Project-specific documentation |
| Broad suggestions | Narrow, targeted suggestions |

## Shared Components
Common utilities are maintained in a shared library:
- Prompt templates
- Context gathering utilities
- Result formatting helpers

## Configuration
Extension settings should be stored in:
- `.vscode/settings.json` for VSCode settings
- `.copilot/config.json` for Copilot-specific settings
