# Development Debt Document

## Overview
This document addresses a technical debt issue with the UV package manager installation in the Docker container used for technical debt management. The UV package manager was being installed but could not be found in the PATH when needed, resulting in the error "/bin/sh: 1: uv: not found" when attempting to use it for package installation.

## Action Items
- [x] Task 1: Fix validate_uv_installation() function in entrypoint.sh to properly handle PATH and symbolic links
- [x] Task 2: Remove duplicate call to validate_uv_installation() in main() function
- [x] Task 3: Fix symbolic link in Dockerfile to use the correct installation path
- [ ] Task 4: Add tests to verify UV package manager is working in the container
- [ ] Task 5: Consider updating Dockerfile to ensure UV is installed in a location that's in PATH by default

## Priority
High

## Estimated Effort
2 Hours

## Implementation Notes
The issue was fixed by:
1. Adding both common installation directories (/root/.local/bin and /usr/local/bin) to PATH early in the script
2. Ensuring PATH changes persist by adding them to ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile
3. Adding logic to verify UV executability and fix permissions if needed
4. Adding fallback installation if UV is not found in any expected location
5. Creating bidirectional symbolic links between common installation directories
6. Adding final validation to confirm installation is successful
7. Removing a duplicate call to validate_uv_installation() in the main function
8. Fixing the Dockerfile to use the correct installation path for the symbolic link (/root/.local/bin/uv instead of ~/.cargo/bin/uv)

The root cause was identified by checking the terminal output from the build process, which showed UV being installed to /root/.local/bin, but the Dockerfile was trying to create a symbolic link from ~/.cargo/bin/uv, which didn't exist.

## Acceptance Criteria
- UV package manager commands work without the "/bin/sh: 1: uv: not found" error
- UV is correctly identified in the PATH and its version is displayed in logs
- The validate_uv_installation() function only runs once during container initialization
- If UV is not found, it is automatically installed and made available
