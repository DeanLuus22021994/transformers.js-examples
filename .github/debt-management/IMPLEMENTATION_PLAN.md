# Technical Debt Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing the technical debt management system across the codebase. The system uses a tagging approach for identifying and tracking technical debt.

## Implementation Sequence
As discussed, the implementation follows the chronological order of how technical debt propagates:

1. `.config`
2. `.copilot`
3. `.devcontainer`
4. `.github`
5. `.husky`
6. `.precompiled`
7. `.scripts`
8. `.vscode`

## Tagging System
The implemented tagging system uses standardized markers:

- `#debt:` - Identified technical debt needing resolution
- `#improve:` - Area that would benefit from improvement
- `#refactor:` - Code that should be refactored
- `#fixme:` - High-priority issues requiring immediate attention
- `#todo:` - Low-priority enhancements or additions

## Implementation Components

### 1. Configuration
- Implemented in `.github/debt-management/config/debt-config.yml`
- Configurable markers, priorities, and file patterns

### 2. Documentation Templates
- Development Debt Document template at `.github/debt-management/templates/DEVELOPMENT_DEBT_TEMPLATE.md`
- GitHub issue template at `.github/debt-management/templates/technical-debt-issue.md`

### 3. Scanning Scripts
- Scan script at `.github/debt-management/scripts/scan-debt.sh`
- Report generation at `.github/debt-management/scripts/generate-report.sh`
- Issue creation at `.github/debt-management/scripts/create-issues.sh`

### 4. Automation
- GitHub Action workflow for automatic scanning on PRs
- Weekly debt report generation and publishing

### 5. Local Execution
- Docker container for consistent execution across environments
- VS Code task integration
- Windows batch file and PowerShell script

## Using The System

### Marking Code with Debt
```javascript
// #debt: This code needs optimization for large datasets
function processBigData(data) {
  // implementation
}
```

### Running the Scanner
- VS Code: Run the "Scan Technical Debt" task
- PowerShell: Run `.\Invoke-DebtScanner.ps1`
- Windows Command: Run `scan-debt.bat`
- Docker directly: Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.debt-scanner.yml up --build`

### Reviewing Reports
Reports are generated in the `debt-reports` directory with:
- Summary of all debt items
- Breakdown by type and location
- Trend analysis
- Recommendations

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with project management tools
- Add visualization dashboards
- Enhance automatic prioritization
- Implement debt reduction tracking
