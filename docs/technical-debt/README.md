# Technical Debt Management System

## Overview

The Technical Debt Management System is an integrated solution that helps teams identify, track, and manage technical debt within the codebase. It consists of a VS Code extension (`dev-debt-processor`) that provides tools for scanning code, generating reports, and managing technical debt documents.

## Key Components

1. **Debt Scanner**
   - Scans codebase for technical debt markers using configurable patterns
   - Generates reports in Markdown format
   - Integrates with VS Code tasks

2. **Debt Reporter**
   - Creates human-readable debt reports
   - Generates trend analysis over time
   - Integrates with VS Code Markdown preview

3. **Configuration System**
   - Supports multiple configuration sources (.yml files, VS Code settings)
   - Provides centralized configuration management

## Using the System

1. **Tag code with debt markers:**

   ```javascript
   // #debt: This needs optimization
   // #improve: Consider using a more efficient algorithm
   // #refactor: This class has too many responsibilities
   ```

2. **Scan for technical debt:**
   - VS Code Command: "Scan Code for Technical Debt"
   - VS Code Task: "Scan Technical Debt"

3. **View Reports:**
   - Open generated reports in VS Code
   - Review trend analysis

4. **Create Debt Documents:**
   - VS Code Command: "Create Dev Debt Template"
   - Follow the template format for new debt items

## Development Debt Document Format

Technical debt documents follow a standardized format:

```markdown
# Development Debt Document

## Overview
[Brief description of the technical debt this document addresses]

## Action Items
- [ ] Task 1: [Clear, specific description]
- [ ] Task 2: [Clear, specific description]
- [ ] Task 3: [Clear, specific description]

## Priority
[High/Medium/Low]

## Estimated Effort
[Hours or story points]

## Implementation Notes
[Any specific implementation details or considerations]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]
- [Criterion 3]

- [file path 1]
- [file path 2]

## Dependencies
[Any dependencies that need to be resolved first]

## Assigned To
[Developer name or team]
```

## Next Steps

1. Run an initial scan to establish a baseline
2. Review the report and prioritize debt items
3. Create detailed debt documents for major items
4. Develop a debt reduction plan
5. Track progress over time using trend reports
