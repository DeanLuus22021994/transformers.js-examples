# Technical Debt Management Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for identifying, tracking, and managing technical debt in the transformers.js-examples repository. The process is designed to be lightweight, integrated with development workflows, and provide visibility into technical debt across the project.

## Identification Process

Technical debt is identified through several mechanisms:

1. **Code Scanning**: Automated scanning for debt markers in the codebase
2. **Code Reviews**: Peer reviews that identify potential debt
3. **Developer Identification**: Direct developer recognition of suboptimal solutions

## Documentation Process

When technical debt is identified, it should be documented following these steps:

1. **Create a Debt Document**:
   - Use the VS Code command "Create Dev Debt Template" or
   - Create a file manually using the [standard template](../../.github/instructions/format_dev_debt_docs.instructions.md)

2. **Document Location**:
   - Store the document in the appropriate subdirectory under `/docs/technical-debt/`
   - Use a descriptive filename related to the debt item

3. **Document Content**:
   - Follow the template structure
   - Be specific about the debt, its impact, and remediation steps
   - Include estimated effort and priority

## Tracking Process

Technical debt is tracked through:

1. **Regular Scans**:
   - Periodic scanning of the codebase
   - Trend analysis of debt over time

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Update debt documents as work progresses
   - Mark tasks as completed when addressed

3. **Pull Request Integration**:
   - Reference debt documents in PRs that address them
   - Use the technical debt section in the PR template

## Remediation Process

Technical debt is addressed through:

1. **Prioritization**:
   - Periodic review of debt items
   - Prioritization based on impact, risk, and effort

2. **Planning**:
   - Include debt items in sprint planning
   - Allocate dedicated time for debt reduction

3. **Implementation**:
   - Address debt items according to documented plan
   - Follow acceptance criteria

4. **Validation**:
   - Verify that debt has been properly addressed
   - Update documentation accordingly

## Reporting Process

Regular reporting includes:

1. **Sprint Reports**:
   - Debt addressed in the current sprint
   - New debt identified

2. **Trend Analysis**:
   - Changes in debt over time
   - Impact of debt reduction efforts

3. **Project Health**:
   - Overall assessment of codebase health
   - Areas of concern

## Integration with Development Workflow

The technical debt management process integrates with the development workflow through:

1. **VS Code Extension**:
   - Integrated scanning and reporting
   - Easy access to debt documentation

2. **Jest Testing**:
   - Test coverage as a metric for code quality
   - Tests that validate debt reduction

3. **Pull Request Template**:
   - Section for technical debt considerations
   - Tracking of debt addressed and introduced

4. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automated scanning during builds
   - Reporting on debt metrics
